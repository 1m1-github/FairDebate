# FairDebate
a fully auto moderated debate platform

A and B want to debate

- need moderator such that A,B do not speak over each other; each has equal time; no censorship (moderator neutrality)

- web app

- A sets up debate with params (how long each side speaks, e.g. 2 min each, then 5 min each, then 2 min each)

- A shares link with B

- When both are on the webapp, debate can be started

- webapp always shows both camera

- at any given time, there A xor B is speaking; only speaker's mic is unmuted; both cam are always on (could also allow audio only)

- merged streams are presented to any viewers by streaming to youtube/twitch/etc.

- youtube (or other) channel serves as long term repository and revenue source

- users get as value: moderated debate for free without needing to find a neutral moderator

- if youtube e.g. censors, we take it down; can upload to other non-censored places for long term persistence
